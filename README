  SPICE
  'In computing, SPICE (the Simple Protocol for Independent Computing
  Environments) is a remote-display system built for virtual
  environments which allows users to view a computing "desktop"
  environment – not only on its computer-server machine, but also
  from anywhere on the Internet – using a wide variety of machine
  architectures.'
